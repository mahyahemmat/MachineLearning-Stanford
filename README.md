# MachineLearning-Stanford
Machine learning algorithms-Coursera specialization
These machine learning projects apply algorithms including: (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI), to differenp problems such as mapping hand written numbers to digital numbers.
